# Let's try out a sort of data analysis-style problem. In
# this problem, you're going to have access to a data set
# covering Georgia Tech's all-time football history. The data
# will be a CSV file, meaning that each line will be a comma-
# separated list of values. Each line will describe one game.
# The columns, from left-to-right, are:
#
# - Date: the date of the game, in Year-Month-Day format.
# - Opponent: the name of the opposing team
# - Location: Home, Away, or Neutral
# - Points For: Points scored by Georgia Tech
# - Points Against: Points scored by the opponent
#
# If Points For is greater than Points Against, then Georgia
# Tech won the game. If Points For is less than Points Against,
# then Georgia Tech lost the game. If the two are equal, then
# the game was a tie.
#
# You can see a subsection of this dataset in season2016.csv
# in the top left, but the actual dataset you'll be accessing
# here will have 1237 games.
#
# Write a function called all_time_record. all_time_record
# should take as input a string representing an opposing team
# name. It should return a string representing the all-time
# record between Georgia Tech and that opponent, in the form
# Wins-Losses-Ties. For example, Georgia Tech has beaten
# Clemson 51 times, lost 28 times, and tied 2 times. So,
# all_time_record("Clemson") would return the string "51-28-2".
#
# We have gone ahead and started the function and opened the
# file for you. The first line of the file are headers:
# Date,Opponent,Location,Points For,Points Against. After that,
# every line is a game.


def all_time_record(opponent):
    # record_file = open('../resource/lib/public/georgia_tech_football.csv', 'r')

    with open('season2016.csv', 'r') as record_file:
        games = record_file.read().split('\n')
        print (games)
        if games[-1] == '':
            del games[-1]
        print (games)
        record = {
            'wins': 0,
            'losses': 0,
            'ties': 0
        }
        for game in games:
            game = game.split(',')
            if game[1] == opponent:
                if int(game[3]) > int(game[4]):
                    record['wins'] += 1
                elif int(game[3]) == int(game[4]):
                    record['ties'] += 1
                else:
                    record['losses'] += 1
        return '{0}-{1}-{2}'.format(record['wins'], record['losses'], record['ties'])

    # Add some code here! Don't forget to close the file when
    # you're done reading from it, before returning.


# Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
# You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
# function with different inputs.
#
# If your function works correctly, this will originally
# print: 51-28-2, 51-33-1, and 29-21-3, each on a separate
# line.
